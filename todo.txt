- Recheck:
  - When vacation switches from 0 to .5, should check if there are any nextYearVacationHalfRolloverVacationHalf days and switch them to vacationRollover
  - When rollover is maxed out, if rollover is removed turn nextYear days into rollover

- Better alert in nextStatus when no vacation days remain.
